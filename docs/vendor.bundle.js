 * AnimationBuilder is an injectable service that is available when the {\@link
 * BrowserAnimationsModule BrowserAnimationsModule} or {\@link NoopAnimationsModule
 * NoopAnimationsModule} modules are used within an application.
 *
 * The purpose if this service is to produce an animation sequence programmatically within an
 * angular component or directive.
 *
 * Programmatic animations are first built and then a player is created when the build animation is
 * attached to an element.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // remember to include the BrowserAnimationsModule module for this to work...
 * import {AnimationBuilder} from '\@angular/animations';
 *
 * class MyCmp {
 *   constructor(private _builder: AnimationBuilder) {}
 *
 *   makeAnimation(element: any) {
 *     // first build the animation
 *     const myAnimation = this._builder.build([
 *       style({ width: 0 }),
 *       animate(1000, style({ width: '100px' }))
 *     ]);
 *
 *     // then create a player from it
 *     const player = myAnimation.create(element);
 *
 *     player.play();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When an animation is built an instance of {\@link AnimationFactory AnimationFactory} will be
 * returned. Using that an {\@link AnimationPlayer AnimationPlayer} can be created which can then be
 * used to start the animation.

 * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the
 * {\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better
 * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression
 * bound to the trigger changes.
 *
 * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the
 * {\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element
 * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that
 * the
 * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\@triggerName]="expression"`.
 *
 * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against
 * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both
 * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values
 * respectively.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The
 * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} declarations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *       state(...),
 *       state(...),
 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Disable Animations
 * A special animation control binding called `\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will
 * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as
 * any animations on the element itself.
 *
 * When true, the `\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example
 * below shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```ts
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [\@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\@.disabled` prevents it from happening
 * (when true).
 *
 * Note that `\@.disabled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on
 * the same element will also be disabled).
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will
 * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular
 * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular
 * component.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   \@HostBinding('\@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\@link query query} for inner
 * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is
 * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\@link
 * animateChild animateChild}.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

/**
 * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given
 * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected
 * to be used within {\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\@link group group}, or {\@link
 * transition transition}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:
 *
 * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay
 * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`
 * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,
 * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the
 * `duration` value in millisecond form.
 * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\@link style style} or {\@link
 * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected
 * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by
 * {\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // various functions for specifying timing data
 * animate(500, style(...))
 * animate("1s", style(...))
 * animate("100ms 0.5s", style(...))
 * animate("5s ease", style(...))
 * animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)", style(...))
 *
 * // either style() of keyframes() can be used
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * animate(500, keyframes([
 *   style({ background: "blue" })),
 *   style({ background: "red" }))
 * ])
 * ```

 *
 * `group` specifies a list of animation steps that are all run in parallel. Grouped animations are
 * useful when a series of styles must be animated/closed off at different starting/ending times.
 *
 * The `group` function can either be used within a {\@link sequence sequence} or a {\@link transition
 * transition} and it will only continue to the next instruction once all of the inner animation
 * steps have completed.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `group` animation function can either consist of {\@link
 * style style} or {\@link animate animate} function calls. Each call to `style()` or `animate()`
 * within a group will be executed instantly (use {\@link keyframes keyframes} or a {\@link
 * animate#usage animate() with a delay value} to offset styles to be applied at a later time).
 *
 * ```typescript

 *
 * `sequence` Specifies a list of animation steps that are run one by one. (`sequence` is used by
 * default when an array is passed as animation data into {\@link transition transition}.)
 *
 * The `sequence` function can either be used within a {\@link group group} or a {\@link transition

 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `sequence` animation function can either consist of

 *
 * `style` declares a key/value object containing CSS properties/styles that can then be used for
 * {\@link state animation states}, within an {\@link sequence animation sequence}, or as styling data
 * for both {\@link animate animate} and {\@link keyframes keyframes}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `style` takes in a key/value string map as data and expects one or more CSS property/value pairs
 * to be defined.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // string values are used for css properties
 * style({ background: "red", color: "blue" })
 *
 * // numerical (pixel) values are also supported

 * #### Auto-styles (using `*`)
 *

 * being animated and applied as animation data when the animation starts.
 *
 * This feature proves useful for a state depending on layout and/or environment factors; in such
 * cases the styles are calculated just before the animation starts.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the steps below will animate from 0 to the
 * // actual height of the element
 * style({ height: 0 }),
 * animate("1s", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```
 *
 * {\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is active within a
 * component then its associated styles will persist on the element that the trigger is attached to
 * (even when the animation ends).
 *
 * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {\@link transition transition} DSL
 * function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\@link trigger
 * trigger} function.
 *
 * #### The `void` state
 *
 * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not
 * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the
 * associated element is void).
 *
 * #### The `*` (default) state
 *
 * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being
 * animated is not declared within the trigger.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles
 * within the given trigger.
 *
 * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.
 * - `styles` refers to the {\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once

 * // the state in which an element is detached from from the application.
 * state("void", style({ height: 0 }))
 *
 * // user-defined states
 * state("closed", style({ height: 0 }))

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link

 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `keyframes` specifies a collection of {\@link style style} entries each optionally characterized
 * by an `offset` value.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `keyframes` animation function is designed to be used alongside the {\@link animate animate}
 * animation function. Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their
 * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the
 * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).
 *
 * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at what
 * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red", offset: 0 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue", offset: 0.2 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange", offset: 0.3 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black", offset: 1 })
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets
 * will be calculated automatically.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red" }) // offset = 0
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue" }) // offset = 0.33
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange" }) // offset = 0.66
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black" }) // offset = 1
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * {\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

/**
 * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `transition` declares the {\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the
 * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>
 * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting
 * and/or ending state).
 *
 * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this
 * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the
 * function is true then the associated animation will be run.
 *
 * Animation transitions are placed within an {\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition
 * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\@link state animation
 * states} is expected to be defined.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on
 * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition
 * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be
 * triggered.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the
 *   // animation has fully completed itself
 *   state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *   state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *
 *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value
 *   // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 *   transition("on => off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions
 *   transition("on <=> off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas
 *   transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into
 *   // the page and the destination state is unknown
 *   transition("void => *", [
 *     style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *     animate(500)
 *   ]),
 *
 *   // this will capture a state change between any states
 *   transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s")),
 *
 *   // you can also go full out and include a function
 *   transition((fromState, toState) => {
 *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked
 *     return fromState == "off" && toState == "on";
 *   }, animate("1s 0s"))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * #### The final `animate` call
 *
 * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a
 * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc
 * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of
 * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the
 * applied state to be presented correctly.
 *
 * ```
 * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state
 * // is currently active for "myAnimationTrigger"
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :enter and :leave
 *
 * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`
 * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*
 * => void` state changes.
 *
 * ```
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 * ]),
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Boolean values
 * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition
 * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.
 *
 * ```
 * // in the template
 * <div [\@openClose]="open ? true : false">...</div>
 *
 * // in the component metadata
 * trigger('openClose', [
 *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),
 *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),
 *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :increment and :decrement
 * In addition to the :enter and :leave transition aliases, the :increment and :decrement aliases
 * can be used to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.
 *
 * ```
 * import {group, animate, query, transition, style, trigger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * import {Component} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'banner-carousel-component',

/**
 * `animateChild` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own
 * animation within the animation sequence.
 *
 * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation
 * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order
 * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements
 * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.
 *
 * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation
 * triggers that will execute at the same time.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="exp =! exp">Toggle</button>
 * <hr>
 *
 * <div [\@parentAnimation]="exp">
 *   <header>Hello</header>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       one
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       two
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       three
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate
 * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations
 * can also fire:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // parent-child.component.ts
 * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'parent-child-component',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('parentAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         query('header', [
 *           style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *         ]),
 *         query('\@childAnimation', [
 *           animateChild()
 *         ])
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     trigger('childAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ParentChildCmp {
 *   exp: boolean = false;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to
 * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the
 * `\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.
 *
 * This example can be further extended by using stagger:
 *
 * ```ts
 * query('\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [
 *   animateChild()
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.
 *
 * ## The first frame of child animations
 * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the
 * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way
 * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the
 * sub animations kick off.
 *
 * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition
 * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`
 * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\@childAnimation` is queried and called
 * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.
 *
 * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\@link query query()} and it will only work
 * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes
 * and transitions are not handled by this API).
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

 * being animated within the sequence. The provided animation steps are applied
 * to the queried element (by default, an array is provided, then this will be
 * treated as an animation sequence).
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * query() is designed to collect mutiple elements and works internally by using
 * `element.querySelectorAll`. An additional options object can be provided which
 * can be used to limit the total amount of items to be collected.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('div', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { limit: 1 })
 * ```
 *
 * query(), by default, will throw an error when zero items are found. If a query
 * has the `optional` flag set to true then this error will be ignored.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { optional: true })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Special Selector Values
 *
 * The selector value within a query can collect elements that contain angular-specific
 * characteristics
 * using special pseudo-selectors tokens.
 *
 * These include:
 *
 *  - Querying for newly inserted/removed elements using `query(":enter")`/`query(":leave")`
 *  - Querying all currently animating elements using `query(":animating")`
 *  - Querying elements that contain an animation trigger using `query("\@triggerName")`
 *  - Querying all elements that contain an animation triggers using `query("\@*")`
 *  - Including the current element into the animation sequence using `query(":self")`
 *
 *
 *  Each of these pseudo-selector tokens can be merged together into a combined query selector
 * string:
 *
 *  ```
 *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, \@subTrigger', [...])
 *  ```
 *
 * ### Demo
 *
 * ```
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'inner',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@queryAnimation]="exp">
 *       <h1>Title</h1>
 *       <div class="content">
 *         Blah blah blah
 *       </div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,

 *    trigger('queryAnimation', [
 *      transition('* => goAnimate', [
 *        // hide the inner elements
 *        query('h1', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *
 *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one
 *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *      ])
 *    ])
 *  ]

/**
 * `stagger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It is designed to be used inside of an animation {\@link query query()}
 * and works by issuing a timing gap between after each queried item is animated.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * In the example below there is a container element that wraps a list of items stamped out
 * by an ngFor. The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set
 * to query for each of the inner items.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- list.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="toggle()">Show / Hide Items</button>
 * <hr />
 * <div [\@listAnimation]="items.length">
 *   <div *ngFor="let item of items">
 *     {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The component code for this looks as such:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('listAnimation', [
 *        //...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ListComponent {
 *   items = [];
 *
 *   showItems() {
 *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];
 *   }
 *
 *   hideItems() {
 *     this.items = [];
 *   }
 *
 *   toggle() {
 *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * And now for the animation trigger code:
 *
 * ```ts
 * trigger('listAnimation', [
 *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes
 *     query(':leave', [
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     query(':enter', [
 *       style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ])
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * Now each time the items are added/removed then either the opacity
 * fade-in animation will run or each removed item will be faded out.
 * When either of these animations occur then a stagger effect will be
 * applied after each item's animation is started.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

 * platforms that angular supports. For example, `\@angular/platform-browser` provides an
 * implementation specific to the browser environment, while `\@angular/platform-webworker` provides
 * one suitable for use with web workers.
 *
 * The `PlatformLocation` class is used directly by all implementations of {\@link LocationStrategy}
 * when they need to interact with the DOM apis like pushState, popState, etc...
 *
 * {\@link LocationStrategy} in turn is used by the {\@link Location} service which is used directly
 * by the {\@link Router} in order to navigate between routes. Since all interactions between {\@link

 * \@whatItDoes `Location` is a service that applications can use to interact with a browser's URL.
 * \@description
 * Depending on which {\@link LocationStrategy} is used, `Location` will either persist
 * to the URL's path or the URL's hash segment.
 *
 * Note: it's better to use {\@link Router#navigate} service to trigger route changes. Use
 * `Location` only if you need to interact with or create normalized URLs outside of
 * routing.
 *
 * `Location` is responsible for normalizing the URL against the application's base href.
 * A normalized URL is absolute from the URL host, includes the application's base href, and has no
 * trailing slash:
 * - `/my/app/user/123` is normalized
 * - `my/app/user/123` **is not** normalized
 * - `/my/app/user/123/` **is not** normalized

 * The date-time pattern shows how to combine separate patterns for date (represented by {1})

 * What you want to pay attention to are:
 * - possibly removing a space for languages that don't use it, such as many East Asian languages
 * - possibly adding a comma, other punctuation, or a combining word
 *
 * For example:
 * - English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` or `{1}, {0}` (depending on date style), while Japanese uses
 *  `{1}{0}`.
 * - An English formatted date-time using the combining pattern `{1}, {0}` could be
 *  `Dec 10, 2010, 3:59:49 PM`. Notice the comma and space between the date portion and the time
 *  portion.
 *
 * There are four formats (`full`, `long`, `medium`, `short`); the determination of which to use
 * is normally based on the date style. For example, if the date has a full month and weekday
 * name, the full combining pattern will be used to combine that with a time. If the date has
 * numeric month, the short version of the combining pattern will be used to combine that with a
 * time. English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` for full and long styles, and `{1}, {0}` for medium and short
 * styles.

 * local equivalents, using the Number Symbols for your language.
 *
 * Here are the special characters used in number patterns:
 *
 * | Symbol | Meaning |
 * |--------|---------|
 * | . | Replaced automatically by the character used for the decimal point. |
 * | , | Replaced by the "grouping" (thousands) separator. |
 * | 0 | Replaced by a digit (or zero if there aren't enough digits). |
 * | # | Replaced by a digit (or nothing if there aren't enough). |
 * | ¤ | This will be replaced by a currency symbol, such as $ or USD. |
 * | % | This marks a percent format. The % symbol may change position, but must be retained. |
 * | E | This marks a scientific format. The E symbol may change position, but must be retained. |

 *
 * \@description
 *
 * The CSS classes are updated as follows, depending on the type of the expression evaluation:
 * - `string` - the CSS classes listed in the string (space delimited) are added,
 * - `Array` - the CSS classes declared as Array elements are added,
 * - `Object` - keys are CSS classes that get added when the expression given in the value
 *              evaluates to a truthy value, otherwise they are removed.

/**
 * Instantiates a single {\@link Component} type and inserts its Host View into current View.
 * `NgComponentOutlet` provides a declarative approach for dynamic component creation.
 *
 * `NgComponentOutlet` requires a component type, if a falsy value is set the view will clear and
 * any existing component will get destroyed.
 *
 * ### Fine tune control
 *
 * You can control the component creation process by using the following optional attributes:
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletInjector`: Optional custom {\@link Injector} that will be used as parent for
 * the Component. Defaults to the injector of the current view container.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletContent`: Optional list of projectable nodes to insert into the content
 * section of the component, if exists.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory`: Optional module factory to allow dynamically loading other
 * module, then load a component from that module.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression"></ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized injector/content
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   injector: injectorExpression;
 *                                   content: contentNodesExpression;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized ngModuleFactory
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   ngModuleFactory: moduleFactory;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 * ## Example
 *
 * {\@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='SimpleExample'}
 *
 * A more complete example with additional options:
 *
 * {\@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='CompleteExample'}

 *
 * {\@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='NgModuleFactoryExample'}

/**
 * The `NgForOf` directive instantiates a template once per item from an iterable. The context
 * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable
 * set to the current item from the iterable.
 *
 * ### Local Variables
 *
 * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:
 *
 * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).
 * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is
 * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |
 * async`).
 * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.
 * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.
 * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.
 * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.
 * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.
 *
 * ```
 * <li *ngFor="let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst">
 *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf="isFirst">default</span>
 * </li>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Change Propagation
 *
 * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce
 * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful
 * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can
 * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state
 * such as user input.
 *
 * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.
 * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that
 * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with
 * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old
 * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should
 * be avoided if possible.
 *
 * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.
 * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.
 * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * - `<li *ngFor="let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn">...</li>`
 *
 * With `<ng-template>` element:
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items" let-i="index" [ngForTrackBy]="trackByFn">
 *   <li>...</li>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed
 * example.

/**
 * Conditionally includes a template based on the value of an `expression`.
 *
 * `ngIf` evaluates the `expression` and then renders the `then` or `else` template in its place
 * when expression is truthy or falsy respectively. Typically the:
 *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.
 *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.
 *
 * ## Most common usage
 *
 * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as
 * seen in this example:
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}
 *
 * ## Showing an alternative template using `else`
 *
 * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template
 * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.
 * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after
 * `ngIf` for readability.
 *
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}
 *
 * ## Using non-inlined `then` template
 *
 * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using
 * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can
 * change at runtime as shown in this example.
 *
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}
 *
 * ## Storing conditional result in a variable
 *
 * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the
 * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against
 * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as
 * when using the `async` pipe as shown in following example:
 *
 * ```
 * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!
 * ```
 *
 * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:
 *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the
 *    example above.
 *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.
 *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.
 *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.
 *
 * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local
 * variable as shown in the the example below:
 *
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}
 *
 * Notice that:
 *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.
 *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.
 *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.
 *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only
 *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.
 *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple form:
 * - `<div *ngIf="condition">...</div>`
 * - `<ng-template [ngIf]="condition"><div>...</div></ng-template>`
 *
 * Form with an else block:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; else elseBlock">...</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with a `then` and `else` block:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
 * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with storing the value locally:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition as value; else elseBlock">{{value}}</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```

 *
 * In other words:
 * - you define a container element (where you place the directive with a switch expression on the
 * `[ngSwitch]="..."` attribute)
 * - you define inner views inside the `NgSwitch` and place a `*ngSwitchCase` attribute on the view
 * root elements.
 *
 * Elements within `NgSwitch` but outside of a `NgSwitchCase` or `NgSwitchDefault` directives will
 * be preserved at the location.
 *
 * The `ngSwitchCase` directive informs the parent `NgSwitch` of which view to display when the
 * expression is evaluated.
 * When no matching expression is found on a `ngSwitchCase` view, the `ngSwitchDefault` view is
 * stamped out.

/**
 * \@ngModule CommonModule
 * \@whatItDoes Formats a date according to locale rules.
 * \@howToUse `date_expression | date[:format[:timezone[:locale]]]`
 * \@description
 *
 * Where:
 * - `expression` is a date object or a number (milliseconds since UTC epoch) or an ISO string
 * (https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).
 * - `format` indicates which date/time components to include. The format can be predefined as
 *   shown below (all examples are given for `en-US`) or custom as shown in the table.
 *   - `'short'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy, h:mm a'` (e.g. `6/15/15, 9:03 AM`)
 *   - `'medium'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y, h:mm:ss a'` (e.g. `Jun 15, 2015, 9:03:01 AM`)
 *   - `'long'`: equivalent to `'MMMM d, y, h:mm:ss a z'` (e.g. `June 15, 2015 at 9:03:01 AM GMT+1`)
 *   - `'full'`: equivalent to `'EEEE, MMMM d, y, h:mm:ss a zzzz'` (e.g. `Monday, June 15, 2015 at
 * 9:03:01 AM GMT+01:00`)
 *   - `'shortDate'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy'` (e.g. `6/15/15`)
 *   - `'mediumDate'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y'` (e.g. `Jun 15, 2015`)
 *   - `'longDate'`: equivalent to `'MMMM d, y'` (e.g. `June 15, 2015`)
 *   - `'fullDate'`: equivalent to `'EEEE, MMMM d, y'` (e.g. `Monday, June 15, 2015`)
 *   - `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm a'` (e.g. `9:03 AM`)
 *   - `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a'` (e.g. `9:03:01 AM`)
 *   - `'longTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a z'` (e.g. `9:03:01 AM GMT+1`)
 *   - `'fullTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a zzzz'` (e.g. `9:03:01 AM GMT+01:00`)
 *  - `timezone` to be used for formatting. It understands UTC/GMT and the continental US time zone
 *  abbreviations, but for general use, use a time zone offset, for example,
 *  `'+0430'` (4 hours, 30 minutes east of the Greenwich meridian)
 *  If not specified, the local system timezone of the end-user's browser will be used.
 *  - `locale` is a `string` defining the locale to use (uses the current {\@link LOCALE_ID} by
 * default)

 * When the expression is a ISO string without time (e.g. 2016-09-19) the time zone offset is not
 * applied and the formatted text will have the same day, month and year of the expression.
 *
 * WARNINGS:
 * - this pipe has only access to en-US locale data by default. If you want to localize the dates
 *   in another language, you will have to import data for other locales.
 *   See the {\@linkDocs guide/i18n#i18n-pipes "I18n guide"} to know how to import additional locale
 *   data.
 * - Fields suffixed with * are only available in the extra dataset.
 *   See the {\@linkDocs guide/i18n#i18n-pipes "I18n guide"} to know how to import extra locale
 *   data.
 * - this pipe is marked as pure hence it will not be re-evaluated when the input is mutated.
 *   Instead users should treat the date as an immutable object and change the reference when the
 *   pipe needs to re-run (this is to avoid reformatting the date on every change detection run
 *   which would be an expensive operation).
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * Assuming `dateObj` is (year: 2015, month: 6, day: 15, hour: 21, minute: 43, second: 11)
 * in the _local_ time and locale is 'en-US':
 *
 * {\@example common/pipes/ts/date_pipe.ts region='DatePipe'}

 * \@whatItDoes Formats a date according to locale rules.
 * \@howToUse `date_expression | date[:format]`
 * \@description
 *
 * Where:
 * - `expression` is a date object or a number (milliseconds since UTC epoch) or an ISO string
 * (https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).
 * - `format` indicates which date/time components to include. The format can be predefined as
 *   shown below or custom as shown in the table.
 *   - `'medium'`: equivalent to `'yMMMdjms'` (e.g. `Sep 3, 2010, 12:05:08 PM` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'short'`: equivalent to `'yMdjm'` (e.g. `9/3/2010, 12:05 PM` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'fullDate'`: equivalent to `'yMMMMEEEEd'` (e.g. `Friday, September 3, 2010` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'longDate'`: equivalent to `'yMMMMd'` (e.g. `September 3, 2010` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'mediumDate'`: equivalent to `'yMMMd'` (e.g. `Sep 3, 2010` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'shortDate'`: equivalent to `'yMd'` (e.g. `9/3/2010` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'jms'` (e.g. `12:05:08 PM` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'jm'` (e.g. `12:05 PM` for `en-US`)

 * In javascript, only the components specified will be respected (not the ordering,
 * punctuations, ...) and details of the formatting will be dependent on the locale.
 *
 * Timezone of the formatted text will be the local system timezone of the end-user's machine.
 *
 * When the expression is a ISO string without time (e.g. 2016-09-19) the time zone offset is not
 * applied and the formatted text will have the same day, month and year of the expression.
 *
 * WARNINGS:
 * - this pipe is marked as pure hence it will not be re-evaluated when the input is mutated.
 *   Instead users should treat the date as an immutable object and change the reference when the
 *   pipe needs to re-run (this is to avoid reformatting the date on every change detection run
 *   which would be an expensive operation).
 * - this pipe uses the Internationalization API. Therefore it is only reliable in Chrome and Opera
 *   browsers.
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * Assuming `dateObj` is (year: 2010, month: 9, day: 3, hour: 12 PM, minute: 05, second: 08)
 * in the _local_ time and locale is 'en-US':
 *
 * {\@example common/pipes/ts/date_pipe.ts region='DeprecatedDatePipe'}

 * \@howToUse `observable_or_promise_expression | async`
 * \@description
 * The `async` pipe subscribes to an `Observable` or `Promise` and returns the latest value it has
 * emitted. When a new value is emitted, the `async` pipe marks the component to be checked for
 * changes. When the component gets destroyed, the `async` pipe unsubscribes automatically to avoid
 * potential memory leaks.
 *
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * This example binds a `Promise` to the view. Clicking the `Resolve` button resolves the
 * promise.
 *
 * {\@example common/pipes/ts/async_pipe.ts region='AsyncPipePromise'}
 *
 * It's also possible to use `async` with Observables. The example below binds the `time` Observable
 * to the view. The Observable continuously updates the view with the current time.

 * \@whatItDoes Formats a number as currency using locale rules.
 * \@howToUse `number_expression | currency[:currencyCode[:display[:digitInfo[:locale]]]]`
 * \@description
 *
 * Use `currency` to format a number as currency.
 *
 * - `currencyCode` is the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code, such
 *    as `USD` for the US dollar and `EUR` for the euro.
 * - `display` indicates whether to show the currency symbol or the code.
 *   - `code`: use code (e.g. `USD`).
 *   - `symbol`(default): use symbol (e.g. `$`).
 *   - `symbol-narrow`: some countries have two symbols for their currency, one regular and one
 *   narrow (e.g. the canadian dollar CAD has the symbol `CA$` and the symbol-narrow `$`).
 *   - boolean (deprecated from v5): `true` for symbol and false for `code`
 *   If there is no narrow symbol for the chosen currency, the regular symbol will be used.
 * - `digitInfo` See {\@link DecimalPipe} for detailed description.
 *  - `locale` is a `string` defining the locale to use (uses the current {\@link LOCALE_ID} by
 * default)
 *
 * ### Example
 *

/**
 * \@ngModule CommonModule
 * \@whatItDoes Creates a new List or String containing a subset (slice) of the elements.
 * \@howToUse `array_or_string_expression | slice:start[:end]`
 * \@description
 *
 * Where the input expression is a `List` or `String`, and:
 * - `start`: The starting index of the subset to return.
 *   - **a positive integer**: return the item at `start` index and all items after
 *     in the list or string expression.
 *   - **a negative integer**: return the item at `start` index from the end and all items after
 *     in the list or string expression.
 *   - **if positive and greater than the size of the expression**: return an empty list or string.
 *   - **if negative and greater than the size of the expression**: return entire list or string.
 * - `end`: The ending index of the subset to return.
 *   - **omitted**: return all items until the end.
 *   - **if positive**: return all items before `end` index of the list or string.
 *   - **if negative**: return all items before `end` index from the end of the list or string.
 *
 * All behavior is based on the expected behavior of the JavaScript API `Array.prototype.slice()`
 * and `String.prototype.slice()`.
 *
 * When operating on a [List], the returned list is always a copy even when all
 * the elements are being returned.
 *
 * When operating on a blank value, the pipe returns the blank value.
 *
 * ## List Example
 *
 * This `ngFor` example:
 *
 * {\@example common/pipes/ts/slice_pipe.ts region='SlicePipe_list'}
 *
 * produces the following:
 *
 *     <li>b</li>

var UNDEFINED=new Object();/**
 * A ReflectiveDependency injection container used for instantiating objects and resolving
 * dependencies.
 *
 * An `Injector` is a replacement for a `new` operator, which can automatically resolve the
 * constructor dependencies.
 *
 * In typical use, application code asks for the dependencies in the constructor and they are
 * resolved by the `Injector`.
 *
 * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/jzjec0?p=preview))
 *
 * The following example creates an `Injector` configured to create `Engine` and `Car`.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * \@Injectable()
 * class Engine {
 * }
 *
 * \@Injectable()
 * class Car {
 *   constructor(public engine:Engine) {}
 * }
 *
 * var injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([Car, Engine]);
 * var car = injector.get(Car);
 * expect(car instanceof Car).toBe(true);
 * expect(car.engine instanceof Engine).toBe(true);
 * ```
 *
 * Notice, we don't use the `new` operator because we explicitly want to have the `Injector`
 * resolve all of the object's dependencies automatically.
 *
 * @deprecated from v5 - slow and brings in a lot of code, Use `Injector.create` instead.

 * can reenter the Angular zone via {\@link #run}.
 *
 * <!-- TODO: add/fix links to:

 * Implements an iterable interface, therefore it can be used in both ES6
 * javascript `for (var i of items)` loops as well as in Angular templates with
 * `*ngFor="let i of myList"`.
 *
 * Changes can be observed by subscribing to the changes `Observable`.
 *
 * NOTE: In the future this class will implement an `Observable` interface.

 *
 * <!-- TODO: move the next two paragraphs to the dev guide -->
 * A View is a fundamental building block of the application UI. It is the smallest grouping of
 * Elements which are created and destroyed together.
 *
 * Properties of elements in a View can change, but the structure (number and order) of elements in
 * a View cannot. Changing the structure of Elements can only be done by inserting, moving or
 * removing nested Views via a {\@link ViewContainerRef}. Each View can contain many View Containers.
 * <!-- /TODO -->
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * Given this template...
 *
 * ```
 * Count: {{items.length}}
 * <ul>
 *   <li *ngFor="let  item of items">{{item}}</li>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * We have two {\@link TemplateRef}s:
 *
 * Outer {\@link TemplateRef}:
 * ```
 * Count: {{items.length}}
 * <ul>
 *   <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items"></ng-template>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * Inner {\@link TemplateRef}:
 * ```
 *   <li>{{item}}</li>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that the original template is broken down into two separate {\@link TemplateRef}s.
 *
 * The outer/inner {\@link TemplateRef}s are then assembled into views like so:
 *
 * ```
 * <!-- ViewRef: outer-0 -->
 * Count: 2
 * <ul>
 *   <ng-template view-container-ref></ng-template>
 *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-1 --><li>first</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-1 -->
 *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-2 --><li>second</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-2 -->
 * </ul>
 * <!-- /ViewRef: outer-0 -->

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the
 * {\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better
 * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression
 * bound to the trigger changes.
 *
 * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the
 * {\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element
 * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that
 * the
 * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\@triggerName]="expression"`.
 *
 * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against
 * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both
 * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values
 * respectively.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The
 * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} declarations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *       state(...),
 *       state(...),
 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Disable Animations
 * A special animation control binding called `\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will
 * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as
 * any animations on the element itself.
 *
 * When true, the `\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example
 * below shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```ts
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [\@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\@.disabled` prevents it from happening
 * (when true).
 *
 * Note that `\@.disabled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on
 * the same element will also be disabled).
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will
 * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular
 * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular
 * component.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   \@HostBinding('\@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\@link query query} for inner
 * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is
 * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\@link
 * animateChild animateChild}.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

 * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given
 * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected
 * to be used within {\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\@link group group}, or {\@link
 * transition transition}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:
 *
 * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay
 * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`
 * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,
 * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the
 * `duration` value in millisecond form.
 * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\@link style style} or {\@link
 * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected
 * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by
 * {\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // various functions for specifying timing data
 * animate(500, style(...))
 * animate("1s", style(...))
 * animate("100ms 0.5s", style(...))
 * animate("5s ease", style(...))
 * animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)", style(...))
 *
 * // either style() of keyframes() can be used
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * animate(500, keyframes([
 *   style({ background: "blue" })),
 *   style({ background: "red" }))
 * ])

 *
 * `group` specifies a list of animation steps that are all run in parallel. Grouped animations are
 * useful when a series of styles must be animated/closed off at different starting/ending times.
 *
 * The `group` function can either be used within a {\@link sequence sequence} or a {\@link transition
 * transition} and it will only continue to the next instruction once all of the inner animation
 * steps have completed.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `group` animation function can either consist of {\@link

 * within a group will be executed instantly (use {\@link keyframes keyframes} or a {\@link

 *
 * `sequence` Specifies a list of animation steps that are run one by one. (`sequence` is used by

 *
 * The `sequence` function can either be used within a {\@link group group} or a {\@link transition

 *
 * `style` declares a key/value object containing CSS properties/styles that can then be used for
 * {\@link state animation states}, within an {\@link sequence animation sequence}, or as styling data
 * for both {\@link animate animate} and {\@link keyframes keyframes}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `style` takes in a key/value string map as data and expects one or more CSS property/value pairs

 *
 * // numerical (pixel) values are also supported

 *

 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of

 *
 * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is active within a
 * component then its associated styles will persist on the element that the trigger is attached to
 * (even when the animation ends).
 *
 * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {\@link transition transition} DSL
 * function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\@link trigger
 * trigger} function.
 *
 * #### The `void` state
 *
 * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not
 * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the
 * associated element is void).
 *
 * #### The `*` (default) state
 *
 * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being
 * animated is not declared within the trigger.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles
 * within the given trigger.
 *
 * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.
 * - `styles` refers to the {\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once
 * the state has been reached.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // "void" is a reserved name for a state and is used to represent
 * // the state in which an element is detached from from the application.
 * state("void", style({ height: 0 }))
 *
 * // user-defined states
 * state("closed", style({ height: 0 }))
 * state("open, visible", style({ height: "*" }))

 *
 * `keyframes` specifies a collection of {\@link style style} entries each optionally characterized
 * by an `offset` value.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `keyframes` animation function is designed to be used alongside the {\@link animate animate}
 * animation function. Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their
 * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the
 * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).
 *
 * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at what
 * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red", offset: 0 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue", offset: 0.2 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange", offset: 0.3 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black", offset: 1 })
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets
 * will be calculated automatically.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red" }) // offset = 0
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue" }) // offset = 0.33
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange" }) // offset = 0.66
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black" }) // offset = 1
 * ]))
 * ```

 * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `transition` declares the {\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the
 * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>
 * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting
 * and/or ending state).
 *
 * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this
 * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the
 * function is true then the associated animation will be run.
 *
 * Animation transitions are placed within an {\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition
 * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\@link state animation
 * states} is expected to be defined.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on
 * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition
 * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be
 * triggered.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the
 *   // animation has fully completed itself
 *   state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *   state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *
 *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value
 *   // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 *   transition("on => off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions
 *   transition("on <=> off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas
 *   transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into
 *   // the page and the destination state is unknown
 *   transition("void => *", [
 *     style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *     animate(500)
 *   ]),
 *
 *   // this will capture a state change between any states
 *   transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s")),
 *
 *   // you can also go full out and include a function
 *   transition((fromState, toState) => {
 *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked
 *     return fromState == "off" && toState == "on";
 *   }, animate("1s 0s"))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * #### The final `animate` call
 *
 * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a
 * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc
 * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of
 * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the
 * applied state to be presented correctly.
 *
 * ```
 * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state
 * // is currently active for "myAnimationTrigger"
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :enter and :leave
 *
 * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`
 * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*
 * => void` state changes.
 *
 * ```
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 * ]),
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Boolean values
 * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition
 * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.
 *
 * ```
 * // in the template
 * <div [\@openClose]="open ? true : false">...</div>
 *
 * // in the component metadata
 * trigger('openClose', [
 *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),
 *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),
 *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :increment and :decrement
 * In addition to the :enter and :leave transition aliases, the :increment and :decrement aliases
 * can be used to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.
 *
 * ```

 * `animateChild` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own
 * animation within the animation sequence.
 *
 * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation
 * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order
 * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements
 * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.
 *
 * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation
 * triggers that will execute at the same time.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="exp =! exp">Toggle</button>
 * <hr>
 *
 * <div [\@parentAnimation]="exp">
 *   <header>Hello</header>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       one
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       two
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       three
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate
 * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations
 * can also fire:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // parent-child.component.ts
 * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'parent-child-component',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('parentAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         query('header', [
 *           style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *         ]),
 *         query('\@childAnimation', [
 *           animateChild()
 *         ])
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     trigger('childAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ParentChildCmp {
 *   exp: boolean = false;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to
 * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the
 * `\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.
 *
 * This example can be further extended by using stagger:
 *
 * ```ts
 * query('\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [
 *   animateChild()
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.
 *
 * ## The first frame of child animations
 * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the
 * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way
 * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the
 * sub animations kick off.
 *
 * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition
 * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`
 * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\@childAnimation` is queried and called
 * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.
 *
 * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\@link query query()} and it will only work
 * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes
 * and transitions are not handled by this API).

 * being animated within the sequence. The provided animation steps are applied
 * to the queried element (by default, an array is provided, then this will be
 * treated as an animation sequence).
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * query() is designed to collect mutiple elements and works internally by using
 * `element.querySelectorAll`. An additional options object can be provided which
 * can be used to limit the total amount of items to be collected.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('div', [

 * ], { limit: 1 })
 * ```
 *
 * query(), by default, will throw an error when zero items are found. If a query

 *
 * ```js

 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { optional: true })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Special Selector Values
 *
 * The selector value within a query can collect elements that contain angular-specific
 * characteristics
 * using special pseudo-selectors tokens.
 *
 * These include:
 *
 *  - Querying for newly inserted/removed elements using `query(":enter")`/`query(":leave")`
 *  - Querying all currently animating elements using `query(":animating")`
 *  - Querying elements that contain an animation trigger using `query("\@triggerName")`
 *  - Querying all elements that contain an animation triggers using `query("\@*")`
 *  - Including the current element into the animation sequence using `query(":self")`
 *
 *
 *  Each of these pseudo-selector tokens can be merged together into a combined query selector
 * string:
 *
 *  ```
 *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, \@subTrigger', [...])
 *  ```
 *
 * ### Demo

 * `stagger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It is designed to be used inside of an animation {\@link query query()}
 * and works by issuing a timing gap between after each queried item is animated.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * In the example below there is a container element that wraps a list of items stamped out
 * by an ngFor. The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set
 * to query for each of the inner items.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- list.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="toggle()">Show / Hide Items</button>
 * <hr />
 * <div [\@listAnimation]="items.length">
 *   <div *ngFor="let item of items">
 *     {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The component code for this looks as such:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('listAnimation', [
 *        //...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ListComponent {
 *   items = [];
 *
 *   showItems() {
 *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];
 *   }
 *
 *   hideItems() {
 *     this.items = [];
 *   }
 *
 *   toggle() {
 *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * And now for the animation trigger code:
 *
 * ```ts
 * trigger('listAnimation', [
 *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes
 *     query(':leave', [
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     query(':enter', [
 *       style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ])
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * Now each time the items are added/removed then either the opacity
 * fade-in animation will run or each removed item will be faded out.
 * When either of these animations occur then a stagger effect will be
 * applied after each item's animation is started.

 * to keep the view synced with the {\@link FormControl} model.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * If you have imported the {\@link FormsModule} or the {\@link ReactiveFormsModule}, this
 * value accessor will be active on any radio control that has a form directive. You do
 * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.
 *
 * ### How to use radio buttons with form directives
 *
 * To use radio buttons in a template-driven form, you'll want to ensure that radio buttons
 * in the same group have the same `name` attribute.  Radio buttons with different `name`
 * attributes do not affect each other.
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/radioButtons/radio_button_example.ts region='TemplateDriven'}
 *
 * When using radio buttons in a reactive form, radio buttons in the same group should have the
 * same `formControlName`. You can also add a `name` attribute, but it's optional.
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/reactiveRadioButtons/reactive_radio_button_example.ts region='Reactive'}
 *
 *  * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`

 * \@whatItDoes Writes values and listens to changes on a select element.
 *
 * Used by {\@link NgModel}, {\@link FormControlDirective}, and {\@link FormControlName}
 * to keep the view synced with the {\@link FormControl} model.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * If you have imported the {\@link FormsModule} or the {\@link ReactiveFormsModule}, this
 * value accessor will be active on any select control that has a form directive. You do
 * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.
 *
 * ### How to use select controls with form directives
 *
 * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`
 * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.
 *
 * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property
 * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the
 * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or
 * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the
 * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Caveat: Option selection
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items
 * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced
 * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the
 * second response will produce objects with different identities.
 *
 * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.
 * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.
 * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.
 *
 * #### Syntax
 *
 * ```
 * <select [compareWith]="compareFn"  [(ngModel)]="selectedCountries">
 *     <option *ngFor="let country of countries" [ngValue]="country">
 *         {{country.name}}
 *     </option>
 * </select>
 *
 * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {
 *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired
 * for selects in Firefox and IE:
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350
 * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/

/**
 * The accessor for writing a value and listening to changes on a select element.
 *
 *  ### Caveat: Options selection
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to select options. It's possible for the identities of items
 * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced
 * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the
 * second response will produce objects with different identities.
 *
 * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select multiple>` supports `compareWith`
 * input. `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.
 * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects options by the return value of the function.
 *
 * #### Syntax
 *
 * ```
 * <select multiple [compareWith]="compareFn"  [(ngModel)]="selectedCountries">
 *     <option *ngFor="let country of countries" [ngValue]="country">
 *         {{country.name}}
 *     </option>
 * </select>
 *
 * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {
 *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.
 *
 * It is one of the three fundamental building blocks of Angular forms, along with
 * {\@link FormGroup} and {\@link FormArray}.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * When instantiating a {\@link FormControl}, you can pass in an initial value as the
 * first argument. Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl('some value');
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'some value'
 * ```
 *
 * You can also initialize the control with a form state object on instantiation,
 * which includes both the value and whether or not the control is disabled.
 * You can't use the value key without the disabled key; both are required
 * to use this way of initialization.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl({value: 'n/a', disabled: true});
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'n/a'
 * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'DISABLED'
 * ```
 *
 * The second {\@link FormControl} argument can accept one of three things:
 * * a sync validator function
 * * an array of sync validator functions
 * * an options object containing validator and/or async validator functions
 *
 * Example of a single sync validator function:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // ''
 * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'INVALID'
 * ```
 *
 * Example using options object:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl('', {
 *    validators: Validators.required,
 *    asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The options object can also be used to define when the control should update.
 * By default, the value and validity of a control updates whenever the value
 * changes. You can configure it to update on the blur event instead by setting
 * the `updateOn` option to `'blur'`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```
 *
 * You can also set `updateOn` to `'submit'`, which will delay value and validity
 * updates until the parent form of the control fires a submit event.
 *
 * See its superclass, {\@link AbstractControl}, for more properties and methods.
 *
 * * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`
 *
 * \@stable

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Tracks the value and validity state of a group of {\@link FormControl}
 * instances.
 *
 * A `FormGroup` aggregates the values of each child {\@link FormControl} into one object,
 * with each control name as the key.  It calculates its status by reducing the statuses
 * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire
 * group becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with {\@link FormControl} and {\@link FormArray}.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * When instantiating a {\@link FormGroup}, pass in a collection of child controls as the first
 * argument. The key for each child will be the name under which it is registered.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),
 * });
 *
 * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}
 * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * You can also include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async
 * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation
 * that considers the value of more than one child control.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 * }, passwordMatchValidator);
 *
 *
 * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {
 *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value
 *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Like {\@link FormControl} instances, you can alternatively choose to pass in
 * validators and async validators as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('')
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')
 * }, {validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator});
 * ```
 *
 * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * group level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormGroup({
 *    one: new FormControl()
 * }, {updateOn: 'blur'});
 * ```
 *
 * * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`
 *
 * \@stable

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Tracks the value and validity state of an array of {\@link FormControl},
 * {\@link FormGroup} or {\@link FormArray} instances.
 *
 * A `FormArray` aggregates the values of each child {\@link FormControl} into an array.
 * It calculates its status by reducing the statuses of its children. For example, if one of
 * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with {\@link FormControl} and {\@link FormGroup}.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * When instantiating a {\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first
 * argument.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   new FormControl('Drew'),
 * ]);
 *
 * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']
 * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * You can also include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy
 * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child
 * control.
 *
 * The two types of validators can be passed in separately as the second and third arg
 * respectively, or together as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy'),
 *   new FormControl('Drew')
 * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});
 * ```
 *
 * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * array level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormArray([
 *    new FormControl()
 * ], {updateOn: 'blur'});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Adding or removing controls
 *
 * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods
 * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the
 * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate
 * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such
 * as broken change detection.
 *
 * * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`
 *
 * \@stable

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Creates a top-level {\@link FormGroup} instance and binds it to a form
 * to track aggregate form value and validation status.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * As soon as you import the `FormsModule`, this directive becomes active by default on
 * all `<form>` tags.  You don't need to add a special selector.
 *
 * You can export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key
 * (ex: `#myForm="ngForm"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying
 * {\@link FormGroup} instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it
 * will give you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as
 * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.
 *
 * To register child controls with the form, you'll want to use {\@link NgModel} with a
 * `name` attribute.  You can also use {\@link NgModelGroup} if you'd like to create
 * sub-groups within the form.
 *
 * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has
 * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form
 * submission event.
 *
 * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.
 * If you want to import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,
 * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, you can add `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`
 * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is
 * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would
 * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Creates a {\@link FormControl} instance from a domain model and binds it
 * to a form control element.
 *
 * The {\@link FormControl} instance will track the value, user interaction, and
 * validation status of the control and keep the view synced with the model. If used
 * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child
 * control.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the
 * `ngModel` selector to activate it.
 *
 * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding
 * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component
 * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax
 * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to
 * the domain model in your class as well.
 *
 * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\@link FormControl} (like
 * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using
 * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar="ngModel"`). You can then access the control using the
 * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)
 * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a
 * full list of properties directly available in {\@link AbstractControlDirective}.
 *
 * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute
 * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.
 *
 * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or
 * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access
 * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:
 * `#f="ngForm"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.
 *
 * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for
 * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather
 * than the domain model's value on submit.
 *
 * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:
 *
 * * Radio buttons: {\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}
 * * Selects: {\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Syncs a standalone {\@link FormControl} instance to a form control element.
 *
 * In other words, this directive ensures that any values written to the {\@link FormControl}
 * instance programmatically will be written to the DOM element (model -> view). Conversely,
 * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the
 * {\@link FormControl} instance (view -> model).
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * Use this directive if you'd like to create and manage a {\@link FormControl} instance directly.
 * Simply create a {\@link FormControl}, save it to your component class, and pass it into the
 * {\@link FormControlDirective}.
 *
 * This directive is designed to be used as a standalone control.  Unlike {\@link FormControlName},
 * it does not require that your {\@link FormControl} instance be part of any parent
 * {\@link FormGroup}, and it won't be registered to any {\@link FormGroupDirective} that
 * exists above it.
 *
 * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the
 * {\@link FormControl} instance. See a full list of available properties in
 * {\@link AbstractControl}.
 *
 * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the {\@link FormControl},
 * or you can set it programmatically later using {\@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or
 * {\@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can
 * subscribe to the {\@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to
 * {\@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is
 * re-calculated.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/simpleFormControl/simple_form_control_example.ts region='Component'}

 * * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`

 * \@whatItDoes Binds an existing {\@link FormGroup} to a DOM element.

 *

 * and {\@link FormArray} instances to child {\@link FormControlName}, {\@link FormGroupName},
 * and {\@link FormArrayName} directives.
 *
 * **Set value**: You can set the form's initial value when instantiating the
 * {\@link FormGroup}, or you can set it programmatically later using the {\@link FormGroup}'s
 * {\@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or {\@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}
 * methods.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the form, you can subscribe

 * \@whatItDoes Syncs a nested {\@link FormGroup} to a DOM element.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * This directive can only be used with a parent {\@link FormGroupDirective} (selector:
 * `[formGroup]`).
 *
 * It accepts the string name of the nested {\@link FormGroup} you want to link, and
 * will look for a {\@link FormGroup} registered with that name in the parent
 * {\@link FormGroup} instance you passed into {\@link FormGroupDirective}.
 *
 * Nested form groups can come in handy when you want to validate a sub-group of a
 * form separately from the rest or when you'd like to group the values of certain
 * controls into their own nested object.
 *
 * **Access the group**: You can access the associated {\@link FormGroup} using the
 * {\@link AbstractControl#get get} method. Ex: `this.form.get('name')`.
 *
 * You can also access individual controls within the group using dot syntax.
 * Ex: `this.form.get('name.first')`
 *
 * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the
 * {\@link FormGroup}. See a full list of available properties in {\@link AbstractControl}.
 *
 * **Set the value**: You can set an initial value for each child control when instantiating
 * the {\@link FormGroup}, or you can set it programmatically later using
 * {\@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or {\@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the group, you can
 * subscribe to the {\@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to
 * {\@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is
 * re-calculated.

 * A pattern that recognizes a commonly useful subset of URLs that are safe.
 *
 * This regular expression matches a subset of URLs that will not cause script
 * execution if used in URL context within a HTML document. Specifically, this
 * regular expression matches if (comment from here on and regex copied from
 * Soy's EscapingConventions):
 * (1) Either a protocol in a whitelist (http, https, mailto or ftp).
 * (2) or no protocol.  A protocol must be followed by a colon. The below
 *     allows that by allowing colons only after one of the characters [/?#].
 *     A colon after a hash (#) must be in the fragment.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a (?) must be in a query.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a single solidus (/) must be in a path.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a double solidus (//) must be in the authority
 *     (before port).
 *
 * The pattern disallows &, used in HTML entity declarations before
 * one of the characters in [/?#]. This disallows HTML entities used in the
 * protocol name, which should never happen, e.g. "h&#116;tp" for "http".
 * It also disallows HTML entities in the first path part of a relative path,
 * e.g. "foo&lt;bar/baz".  Our existing escaping functions should not produce
 * that. More importantly, it disallows masking of a colon,
 * e.g. "javascript&#58;...".

/**
 * DomSanitizer helps preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by sanitizing
 * values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts.
 *
 * For example, when binding a URL in an `<a [href]="someValue">` hyperlink, `someValue` will be
 * sanitized so that an attacker cannot inject e.g. a `javascript:` URL that would execute code on
 * the website.
 *
 * In specific situations, it might be necessary to disable sanitization, for example if the
 * application genuinely needs to produce a `javascript:` style link with a dynamic value in it.
 * Users can bypass security by constructing a value with one of the `bypassSecurityTrust...`
 * methods, and then binding to that value from the template.
 *
 * These situations should be very rare, and extraordinary care must be taken to avoid creating a
 * Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bug!
 *
 * When using `bypassSecurityTrust...`, make sure to call the method as early as possible and as
 * close as possible to the source of the value, to make it easy to verify no security bug is
 * created by its use.
 *
 * It is not required (and not recommended) to bypass security if the value is safe, e.g. a URL that
 * does not start with a suspicious protocol, or an HTML snippet that does not contain dangerous
 * code. The sanitizer leaves safe values intact.
 *
 * \@security Calling any of the `bypassSecurityTrust...` APIs disables Angular's built-in
 * sanitization for the value passed in. Carefully check and audit all values and code paths going
 * into this call. Make sure any user data is appropriately escaped for this security context.
 * For more detail, see the [Security Guide](http://g.co/ng/security).

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Lets you link to specific parts of your app.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * Consider the following route configuration:
 * `[{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]`
 *
 * When linking to this `user/:name` route, you can write:
 * `<a routerLink='/user/bob'>link to user component</a>`
 *
 * \@description
 *
 * The RouterLink directives let you link to specific parts of your app.
 *
 * When the link is static, you can use the directive as follows:
 * `<a routerLink="/user/bob">link to user component</a>`
 *
 * If you use dynamic values to generate the link, you can pass an array of path
 * segments, followed by the params for each segment.
 *
 * For instance `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`
 * means that we want to generate a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.
 *
 * Multiple static segments can be merged into one
 * (e.g., `['/team/11/user', userName, {details: true}]`).
 *
 * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`:
 * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router will look up the route from the root of the
 *   app.
 * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router will
 *   instead look in the children of the current activated route.
 * * And if the first segment begins with `../`, the router will go up one level.
 *
 * You can set query params and fragment as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" fragment="education">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 * RouterLink will use these to generate this link: `/user/bob#education?debug=true`.
 *
 * (Deprecated in v4.0.0 use `queryParamsHandling` instead) You can also tell the
 * directive to preserve the current query params and fragment:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" preserveQueryParams preserveFragment>
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can tell the directive to how to handle queryParams, available options are:
 *  - `'merge'`: merge the queryParams into the current queryParams
 *  - `'preserve'`: preserve the current queryParams
 *  - default/`''`: use the queryParams only
 *
 * Same options for {\@link NavigationExtras#queryParamsHandling
 * NavigationExtras#queryParamsHandling}.
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" queryParamsHandling="merge">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * The router link directive always treats the provided input as a delta to the current url.
 *
 * For instance, if the current url is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.
 *
 * Then the following link `<a [routerLink]="['/user/jim']">Jim</a>` will generate the link
 * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.
 *
 * See {\@link Router#createUrlTree createUrlTree} for more information.

 * \@whatItDoes Lets you add a CSS class to an element when the link's route becomes active.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * \@description
 *
 * The RouterLinkActive directive lets you add a CSS class to an element when the link's route
 * becomes active.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * When the url is either '/user' or '/user/bob', the active-link class will
 * be added to the `a` tag. If the url changes, the class will be removed.
 *
 * You can set more than one class, as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="class1 class2">Bob</a>
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" [routerLinkActive]="['class1', 'class2']">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can configure RouterLinkActive by passing `exact: true`. This will add the classes
 * only when the url matches the link exactly.
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact:
 * true}">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can assign the RouterLinkActive instance to a template variable and directly check
 * the `isActive` status.
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive #rla="routerLinkActive">
 *   Bob {{ rla.isActive ? '(already open)' : ''}}
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * Finally, you can apply the RouterLinkActive directive to an ancestor of a RouterLink.
 *
 * ```
 * <div routerLinkActive="active-link" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact: true}">
 *   <a routerLink="/user/jim">Jim</a>
 *   <a routerLink="/user/bob">Bob</a>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * This will set the active-link class on the div tag if the url is either '/user/jim' or
 * '/user/bob'.

 * \@howToUse
 *
 * RouterModule can be imported multiple times: once per lazily-loaded bundle.
 * Since the router deals with a global shared resource--location, we cannot have
 * more than one router service active.
 *
 * That is why there are two ways to create the module: `RouterModule.forRoot` and
 * `RouterModule.forChild`.
 *
 * * `forRoot` creates a module that contains all the directives, the given routes, and the router
 *   service itself.
 * * `forChild` creates a module that contains all the directives and the given routes, but does not
 *   include the router service.
 *
 * When registered at the root, the module should be used as follows
 *
 * ```
 * \@NgModule({
 *   imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(ROUTES)]
 * })
 * class MyNgModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * For submodules and lazy loaded submodules the module should be used as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * \@NgModule({
 *   imports: [RouterModule.forChild(ROUTES)]
 * })
 * class MyNgModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * \@description
 *
 * Managing state transitions is one of the hardest parts of building applications. This is
 * especially true on the web, where you also need to ensure that the state is reflected in the URL.
 * In addition, we often want to split applications into multiple bundles and load them on demand.

     * Invokes an execution of an Observable and registers Observer handlers for notifications it will emit.
     *
     * <span class="informal">Use it when you have all these Observables, but still nothing is happening.</span>
     *
     * `subscribe` is not a regular operator, but a method that calls Observable's internal `subscribe` function. It
     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is
     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling
     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often
     * thought.
     *
     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values
     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two
     * following ways.
     *
     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods
     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create
     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do
     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also
     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't
     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will
     * be left uncaught.
     *
     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.
     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent
     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,
     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,
     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes
     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.
     *
     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.
     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean
     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback
     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.
     *
     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.
     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}
     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable
     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.
     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>
     * const sumObserver = {
     *   sum: 0,
     *   next(value) {
     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);
     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;
     *   },
     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,
     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.
     *   complete() {
     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);
     *   }
     * };
     *
     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.
     * .subscribe(sumObserver);
     *
     * // Logs:
     * // "Adding: 1"
     * // "Adding: 2"
     * // "Adding: 3"
     * // "Sum equals: 6"
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe with functions</caption>
     * let sum = 0;
     *
     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)
     * .subscribe(
     *   function(value) {
     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);

     * // "Adding: 2"
     * // "Adding: 3"
     * // "Sum equals: 6"
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Cancel a subscription</caption>
     * const subscription = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).subscribe(

     * Converts a callback API to a function that returns an Observable.
     *
     * <span class="informal">Give it a function `f` of type `f(x, callback)` and
     * it will return a function `g` that when called as `g(x)` will output an
     * Observable.</span>
     *
     * `bindCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not
     * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, the
     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is
     * done.
     *
     * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters
     * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function
     * is called with arguments it will return an Observable. If function `func`
     * calls its callback with one argument the Observable will emit that value.
     * If on the other hand the callback is called with multiple values the resulting
     * Observable will emit an array with said values as arguments.
     *
     * It is very important to remember that input function `func` is not called
     * when the output function is, but rather when the Observable returned by the output
     * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes an AJAX request, that request
     * will be made every time someone subscribes to the resulting Observable, but not before.
     *
     * Optionally, a selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. The selector function
     * takes the same arguments as the callback and returns the value that will be emitted by the Observable.
     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as an array
     * the selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as the callback would.
     * This means you can imagine the default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)
     * as a function that aggregates all its arguments into an array, or simply returns first argument
     * if there is only one.
     *
     * The last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when the call
     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results
     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default, the subscription to  an Observable calls `func`
     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as the last parameter will defer the call to `func`,
     * just like wrapping the call in `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0` would. If you use the async Scheduler
     * and call `subscribe` on the output Observable all function calls that are currently executing
     * will end before `func` is invoked.
     *
     * By default results passed to the callback are emitted immediately after `func` invokes the callback.
     * In particular, if the callback is called synchronously the subscription of the resulting Observable
     * will call the `next` function synchronously as well.  If you want to defer that call,
     * you may use `Scheduler.async` just as before.  This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can
     * ensure that `func` always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.
     *
     * Note that the Observable created by the output function will always emit a single value
     * and then complete immediately. If `func` calls the callback multiple times, values from subsequent
     * calls will not appear in the stream. If you need to listen for multiple calls,
     *  you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or {@link fromEventPattern} instead.
     *
     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property) and is not already bound the context of `func`
     * will be the context that the output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`
     * is called as a method of some objec and if `func` is not already bound, in order to preserve the context
     * it is recommended that the context of the output function is set to that object as well.
     *
     * If the input function calls its callback in the "node style" (i.e. first argument to callback is
     * optional error parameter signaling whether the call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}
     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.
     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions the same as any other and error parameters
     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.
     *

     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>
     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)
     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);
     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');
     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));

     * Converts a Node.js-style callback API to a function that returns an

     *
     * <span class="informal">It's just like {@link bindCallback}, but the
     * callback is expected to be of type `callback(error, result)`.</span>
     *
     * `bindNodeCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not
     * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the
     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is
     * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,
     * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling
     * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means
     * something went wrong.
     *
     * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same
     * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output
     * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.
     * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will
     * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit
     * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),
     * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.
     *
     * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to
     * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular
     * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but
     * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.
     *
     * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,
     * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to
     * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed
     * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler
     * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.
     * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where
     * Scheduler works exactly the same.
     *
     * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context
     * of returned function, when it is called.
     *
     * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means
     * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive
     * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions
     * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or
     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.
     *
     * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.
     * "Node.js-style" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for
     * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,
     * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.
     *
     * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance
     * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.
     * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as "present", when value
     * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty
     * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error
     * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when
     * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you
     * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,
     * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.
     *
     * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value
     * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable or in selector function.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>
     * import * as fs from 'fs';
     * var readFileAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);
     * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');
     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));

     * Observable.

     * Joins last values emitted by passed Observables.

     * <span class="informal">Wait for Observables to complete and then combine last values they emitted.</span>
     *
     * <img src="./img/forkJoin.png" width="100%">
     *
     * `forkJoin` is an operator that takes any number of Observables which can be passed either as an array
     * or directly as arguments. If no input Observables are provided, resulting stream will complete
     * immediately.
     *
     * `forkJoin` will wait for all passed Observables to complete and then it will emit an array with last
     * values from corresponding Observables. So if you pass `n` Observables to the operator, resulting
     * array will have `n` values, where first value is the last thing emitted by the first Observable,
     * second value is the last thing emitted by the second Observable and so on. That means `forkJoin` will
     * not emit more than once and it will complete after that. If you need to emit combined values not only
     * at the end of lifecycle of passed Observables, but also throughout it, try out {@link combineLatest}
     * or {@link zip} instead.
     *
     * In order for resulting array to have the same length as the number of input Observables, whenever any of
     * that Observables completes without emitting any value, `forkJoin` will complete at that moment as well
     * and it will not emit anything either, even if it already has some last values from other Observables.
     * Conversely, if there is an Observable that never completes, `forkJoin` will never complete as well,
     * unless at any point some other Observable completes without emitting value, which brings us back to
     * the previous case. Overall, in order for `forkJoin` to emit a value, all Observables passed as arguments
     * have to emit something at least once and complete.
     *
     * If any input Observable errors at some point, `forkJoin` will error as well and all other Observables
     * will be immediately unsubscribed.
     *
     * Optionally `forkJoin` accepts project function, that will be called with values which normally
     * would land in emitted array. Whatever is returned by project function, will appear in output
     * Observable instead. This means that default project can be thought of as a function that takes
     * all its arguments and puts them into an array. Note that project function will be called only
     * when output Observable is supposed to emit a result.
     *
     * @example <caption>Use forkJoin with operator emitting immediately</caption>
     * const observable = Rx.Observable.forkJoin(
     *   Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3, 4),
     *   Rx.Observable.of(5, 6, 7, 8)
     * );

     *   value => console.log(value),

     *   () => console.log('This is how it ends!')
     * );
     *
     * // Logs:
     * // [4, 8]
     * // "This is how it ends!"
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use forkJoin with operator emitting after some time</caption>
     * const observable = Rx.Observable.forkJoin(
     *   Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(3), // emit 0, 1, 2 every second and complete
     *   Rx.Observable.interval(500).take(4) // emit 0, 1, 2, 3 every half a second and complete
     * );

     *

     * EventEmitter events or others.</span>
     *
     * <img src="./img/fromEvent.png" width="100%">
     *
     * `fromEvent` accepts as a first argument event target, which is an object with methods
     * for registering event handler functions. As a second argument it takes string that indicates
     * type of event we want to listen for. `fromEvent` supports selected types of event targets,
     * which are described in detail below. If your event target does not match any of the ones listed,
     * you should use {@link fromEventPattern}, which can be used on arbitrary APIs.
     * When it comes to APIs supported by `fromEvent`, their methods for adding and removing event
     * handler functions have different names, but they all accept a string describing event type
     * and function itself, which will be called whenever said event happens.
     *
     * Every time resulting Observable is subscribed, event handler function will be registered
     * to event target on given event type. When that event fires, value
     * passed as a first argument to registered function will be emitted by output Observable.
     * When Observable is unsubscribed, function will be unregistered from event target.
     *
     * Note that if event target calls registered function with more than one argument, second
     * and following arguments will not appear in resulting stream. In order to get access to them,
     * you can pass to `fromEvent` optional project function, which will be called with all arguments
     * passed to event handler. Output Observable will then emit value returned by project function,
     * instead of the usual value.
     *
     * Remember that event targets listed below are checked via duck typing. It means that
     * no matter what kind of object you have and no matter what environment you work in,
     * you can safely use `fromEvent` on that object if it exposes described methods (provided
     * of course they behave as was described above). So for example if Node.js library exposes
     * event target which has the same method names as DOM EventTarget, `fromEvent` is still
     * a good choice.
     *
     * If the API you use is more callback then event handler oriented (subscribed
     * callback function fires only once and thus there is no need to manually
     * unregister it), you should use {@link bindCallback} or {@link bindNodeCallback}
     * instead.
     *
     * `fromEvent` supports following types of event targets:
     *
     * **DOM EventTarget**
     *
     * This is an object with `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.
     *
     * In the browser, `addEventListener` accepts - apart from event type string and event
     * handler function arguments - optional third parameter, which is either an object or boolean,
     * both used for additional configuration how and when passed function will be called. When
     * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values
     * as third parameter as well.
     *
     * **Node.js EventEmitter**
     *
     * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.
     *
     * **JQuery-style event target**
     *
     * An object with `on` and `off` methods
     *
     * **DOM NodeList**
     *
     * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.
     *
     * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes
     * it contains and install event handler function in every of them. When returned Observable
     * is unsubscribed, function will be removed from all Nodes.
     *
     * **DOM HtmlCollection**
     *
     * Just as in case of NodeList it is a collection of DOM nodes. Here as well event handler function is
     * installed and removed in each of elements.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Emits clicks happening on the DOM document</caption>
     * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
     * clicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
     *
     * // Results in:
     * // MouseEvent object logged to console every time a click
     * // occurs on the document.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use addEventListener with capture option</caption>
     * var clicksInDocument = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click', true); // note optional configuration parameter
     *                                                                          // which will be passed to addEventListener
     * var clicksInDiv = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(someDivInDocument, 'click');
     *
     * clicksInDocument.subscribe(() => console.log('document'));
     * clicksInDiv.subscribe(() => console.log('div'));
     *
     * // By default events bubble UP in DOM tree, so normally
     * // when we would click on div in document
     * // "div" would be logged first and then "document".
     * // Since we specified optional `capture` option, document
     * // will catch event when it goes DOWN DOM tree, so console
     * // will log "document" and then "div".

/**
 * Combines multiple Observables to create an Observable whose values are
 * calculated from the latest values of each of its input Observables.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it
 * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits
 * the output of that formula.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/combineLatest.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as
 * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,
 * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent
 * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,
 * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order
 * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable
 * on the first place and so on).
 *
 * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables
 * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of
 * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables
 * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that
 * completes immediately.
 *
 * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will
 * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,
 * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits
 * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last
 * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but
 * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without
 * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from
 * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does
 * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit
 * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some
 * value.
 *
 * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables
 * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined
 * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of
 * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case
 * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last
 * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`
 * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.
 *
 * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes
 * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.
 * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable
 * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array
 * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined
 * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>
 * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now
 * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now
 * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);
 * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0] after 0.5s
 * // [1, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 1] after 1.5s
 * // [2, 1] after 2s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>
 * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(
 *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds
 * );
 * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);
 * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0, 0] immediately
 * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s
 * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>
 * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);
 * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);
 * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));
 * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));

 *
 * <span class="informal">Concatenates multiple Observables together by
 * sequentially emitting their values, one Observable after the other.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/concat.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `concat` joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and
 * merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of
 * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result
 * in Observable that completes immediately.
 *
 * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without
 * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will
 * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be
 * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,
 * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator
 * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out
 * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,
 * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.
 *
 * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete
 * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other
 * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be
 * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.
 *
 * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,
 * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after
 * the one that emitted error, never will.
 *
 * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values
 * will be "replayed" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable
 * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,
 * you can always use {@link repeat}.
 *
 * @example <caption>Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10</caption>
 * var timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(4);
 * var sequence = Rx.Observable.range(1, 10);

 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * // results in:
 * // 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> 2 -1000ms-> 3 -immediate-> 1 ... 10
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Concatenate an array of 3 Observables</caption>
 * var timer1 = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(10);
 * var timer2 = Rx.Observable.interval(2000).take(6);
 * var timer3 = Rx.Observable.interval(500).take(10);
 * var result = Rx.Observable.concat([timer1, timer2, timer3]); // note that array is passed
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * // results in the following:
 * // (Prints to console sequentially)
 * // -1000ms-> 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> ... 9
 * // -2000ms-> 0 -2000ms-> 1 -2000ms-> ... 5
 * // -500ms-> 0 -500ms-> 1 -500ms-> ... 9
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Concatenate the same Observable to repeat it</caption>
 * const timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(2);
 *
 * Rx.Observable.concat(timer, timer) // concating the same Observable!

 * Observable will be immediately emitted on the output Observable.
 *
 * @example <caption>Merge together two Observables: 1s interval and clicks</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 * var clicksOrTimer = Rx.Observable.merge(clicks, timer);
 * clicksOrTimer.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * // Results in the following:
 * // timer will emit ascending values, one every second(1000ms) to console
 * // clicks logs MouseEvents to console everytime the "document" is clicked
 * // Since the two streams are merged you see these happening
 * // as they occur.
 *
 * @example <caption>Merge together 3 Observables, but only 2 run concurrently</caption>
 * var timer1 = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(10);
 * var timer2 = Rx.Observable.interval(2000).take(6);
 * var timer3 = Rx.Observable.interval(500).take(10);
 * var concurrent = 2; // the argument
 * var merged = Rx.Observable.merge(timer1, timer2, timer3, concurrent);
 * merged.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * // Results in the following:
 * // - First timer1 and timer2 will run concurrently
 * // - timer1 will emit a value every 1000ms for 10 iterations
 * // - timer2 will emit a value every 2000ms for 6 iterations
 * // - after timer1 hits it's max iteration, timer2 will
 * //   continue, and timer3 will start to run concurrently with timer2
 * // - when timer2 hits it's max iteration it terminates, and

 * Allows source Observable to be subscribed only once with a Subject of choice,

 *
 * <span class="informal">Subscribe to Observable once, but send its values to multiple subscribers.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/multicast.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `multicast` is an operator that works in two modes.
 *
 * In the first mode you provide a single argument to it, which can be either an initialized Subject or a Subject
 * factory. As a result you will get a special kind of an Observable - a {@link ConnectableObservable}. It can be
 * subscribed multiple times, just as regular Observable, but it won't subscribe to the source Observable at that
 * moment. It will do it only if you call its `connect` method. This means you can essentially control by hand, when
 * source Observable will be actually subscribed. What is more, ConnectableObservable will share this one subscription
 * between all of its subscribers. This means that, for example, `ajax` Observable will only send a request once,
 * even though usually it would send a request per every subscriber. Since it sends a request at the moment of
 * subscription, here request would be sent when the `connect` method of a ConnectableObservable is called.
 *
 * The most common pattern of using ConnectableObservable is calling `connect` when the first consumer subscribes,
 * keeping the subscription alive while several consumers come and go and finally unsubscribing from the source
 * Observable, when the last consumer unsubscribes. To not implement that logic over and over again,
 * ConnectableObservable has a special operator, `refCount`. When called, it returns an Observable, which will count
 * the number of consumers subscribed to it and keep ConnectableObservable connected as long as there is at least
 * one consumer. So if you don't actually need to decide yourself when to connect and disconnect a
 * ConnectableObservable, use `refCount`.
 *
 * The second mode is invoked by calling `multicast` with an additional, second argument - selector function.
 * This function accepts an Observable - which basically mirrors the source Observable - and returns Observable
 * as well, which should be the input stream modified by any operators you want. Note that in this
 * mode you cannot provide initialized Subject as a first argument - it has to be a Subject factory. If
 * you provide selector function, `multicast` returns just a regular Observable, instead of ConnectableObservable.
 * Thus, as usual, each subscription to this stream triggers subscription to the source Observable. However,
 * if inside the selector function you subscribe to the input Observable multiple times, actual source stream
 * will be subscribed only once. So if you have a chain of operators that use some Observable many times,
 * but you want to subscribe to that Observable only once, this is the mode you would use.
 *
 * Subject provided as a first parameter of `multicast` is used as a proxy for the single subscription to the
 * source Observable. It means that all values from the source stream go through that Subject. Thus, if a Subject
 * has some special properties, Observable returned by `multicast` will have them as well. If you want to use
 * `multicast` with a Subject that is one of the ones included in RxJS by default - {@link Subject},
 * {@link AsyncSubject}, {@link BehaviorSubject}, or {@link ReplaySubject} - simply use {@link publish},
 * {@link publishLast}, {@link publishBehavior} or {@link publishReplay} respectively. These are actually
 * just wrappers around `multicast`, with a specific Subject hardcoded inside.
 *
 * Also, if you use {@link publish} or {@link publishReplay} with a ConnectableObservables `refCount` operator,
 * you can simply use {@link share} and {@link shareReplay} respectively, which chain these two.
 *
 * @example <caption>Use ConnectableObservable</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 * const connectableSeconds = seconds.multicast(new Subject());
 *
 * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('first: ' + value));
 * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('second: ' + value));
 *
 * // At this point still nothing happens, even though we subscribed twice.
 *
 * connectableSeconds.connect();
 *
 * // From now on `seconds` are being logged to the console,
 * // twice per every second. `seconds` Observable was however only subscribed once,
 * // so under the hood Observable.interval had only one clock started.
 *
 * @example <caption>Use selector</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds
 *     .multicast(
 *         () => new Subject(),
 *         seconds => seconds.zip(seconds) // Usually zip would subscribe to `seconds` twice.
 *                                         // Because we are inside selector, `seconds` is subscribed once,
 *     )                                   // thus starting only one clock used internally by Observable.interval.

 * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>
 *
 * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule
 * notifications emitted by the source Observable. It might be useful, if you do not have control over
 * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.
 *
 * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,
 * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal
 * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits
 * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.
 * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split
 * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source
 * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a
 * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.
 *
 * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications
 * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`
 * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error
 * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator
 * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used
 * for notification emissions in general.

 *
 * <img src="./img/onErrorResumeNext.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` is an operator that accepts a series of Observables, provided either directly as
 * arguments or as an array. If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same
 * as the source.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.
 * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`
 * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting
 * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another
 * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will
 * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will
 * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore thought of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive
 * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable
 * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with
 * an error.
 *
 * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not
 * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link subscribe}. If you want to take
 * specific actions based on what error was emitted by an Observable, you should try out {@link catch} instead.

 *
 * `timeout` operator accepts as an argument either a number or a Date.
 *
 * If number was provided, it returns an Observable that behaves like a source
 * Observable, unless there is a period of time where there is no value emitted.
 * So if you provide `100` as argument and first value comes after 50ms from
 * the moment of subscription, this value will be simply re-emitted by the resulting
 * Observable. If however after that 100ms passes without a second value being emitted,
 * stream will end with an error and source Observable will be unsubscribed.
 * These checks are performed throughout whole lifecycle of Observable - from the moment
 * it was subscribed to, until it completes or errors itself. Thus every value must be
 * emitted within specified period since previous value.
 *
 * If provided argument was Date, returned Observable behaves differently. It throws
 * if Observable did not complete before provided Date. This means that periods between
 * emission of particular values do not matter in this case. If Observable did not complete
 * before provided Date, source Observable will be unsubscribed. Other than that, resulting
 * stream behaves just as source Observable.
 *
 * `timeout` accepts also a Scheduler as a second parameter. It is used to schedule moment (or moments)
 * when returned Observable will check if source stream emitted value or completed.
 *
 * @example <caption>Check if ticks are emitted within certain timespan</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(1100) // Let's use bigger timespan to be safe,
 *                       // since `interval` might fire a bit later then scheduled.
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit numbers just as regular `interval` would.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will never be called.
 * );
 *
 * seconds.timeout(900).subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will never be called.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will emit error before even first value is emitted,
 *                             // since it did not arrive within 900ms period.
 * );
 *
 * @example <caption>Use Date to check if Observable completed</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(new Date("December 17, 2020 03:24:00"))
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit values as regular `interval` would
 *                                  // until December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00.
 *     err => console.log(err) // On December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00 it will emit an error,

 *
 * <img src="./img/timeoutWith.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `timeoutWith` is a variation of `timeout` operator. It behaves exactly the same,
 * still accepting as a first argument either a number or a Date, which control - respectively -
 * when values of source Observable should be emitted or when it should complete.
 *
 * The only difference is that it accepts a second, required parameter. This parameter
 * should be an Observable which will be subscribed when source Observable fails any timeout check.
 * So whenever regular `timeout` would emit an error, `timeoutWith` will instead start re-emitting
 * values from second Observable. Note that this fallback Observable is not checked for timeouts
 * itself, so it can emit values and complete at arbitrary points in time. From the moment of a second
 * subscription, Observable returned from `timeoutWith` simply mirrors fallback stream. When that
 * stream completes, it completes as well.
 *
 * Scheduler, which in case of `timeout` is provided as as second argument, can be still provided
 * here - as a third, optional parameter. It still is used to schedule timeout checks and -
 * as a consequence - when second Observable will be subscribed, since subscription happens
 * immediately after failing check.
 *
 * @example <caption>Add fallback observable</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 * const minutes = Rx.Observable.interval(60 * 1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeoutWith(900, minutes)
 *     .subscribe(

 * use might result in memory leaks. To help alleviate this in some scenarios, an optional `flushes` parameter is also provided so

 *
 * If called with no arguments, `first` emits the first value of the source
 * Observable, then completes. If called with a `predicate` function, `first`
 * emits the first value of the source that matches the specified condition. It
 * may also take a `resultSelector` function to produce the output value from
 * the input value, and a `defaultValue` to emit in case the source completes
 * before it is able to emit a valid value. Throws an error if `defaultValue`
 * was not provided and a matching element is not found.
 *
 * @example <caption>Emit only the first click that happens on the DOM</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var result = clicks.first();
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * @example <caption>Emits the first click that happens on a DIV</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var result = clicks.first(ev => ev.target.tagName === 'DIV');
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * @see {@link filter}
 * @see {@link find}
 * @see {@link take}
 *
 * @throws {EmptyError} Delivers an EmptyError to the Observer's `error`
 * callback if the Observable completes before any `next` notification was sent.
 *
 * @param {function(value: T, index: number, source: Observable<T>): boolean} [predicate]

 * @param {function(value: T, index: number): R} [resultSelector] A function to

 * function are:
 * - `value`: the value that was emitted on the source.

/**
 *
 * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>
 *
 * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule
 * notifications emitted by the source Observable. It might be useful, if you do not have control over
 * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.
 *
 * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,
 * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal
 * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits
 * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.
 * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split
 * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source
 * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a
 * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.
 *
 * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications
 * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`
 * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error
 * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator
 * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used
 * for notification emissions in general.
 *
 * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>
 * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled
 *                                               // with async scheduler by default...
 *
 * intervals
 * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame
 * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.
 *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';
 * });
 *
 * @see {@link delay}
 *
 * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.
 * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.
 * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,

 * When any of the provided Observable emits an complete or error notification, it immediately subscribes to the next one

 *
 * <span class="informal">Execute series of Observables no matter what, even if it means swallowing errors.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/onErrorResumeNext.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` is an operator that accepts a series of Observables, provided either directly as
 * arguments or as an array. If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same
 * as the source.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.
 * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`
 * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting
 * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another
 * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will
 * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will
 * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore thought of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive
 * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable
 * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with
 * an error.
 *
 * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not
 * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link subscribe}. If you want to take
 * specific actions based on what error was emitted by an Observable, you should try out {@link catch} instead.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Subscribe to the next Observable after map fails</caption>
 * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3, 0)
 *   .map(x => {
 *       if (x === 0) { throw Error(); }
         return 10 / x;
 *   })
 *   .onErrorResumeNext(Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3))
 *   .subscribe(
 *     val => console.log(val),
 *     err => console.log(err),          // Will never be called.
 *     () => console.log('that\'s it!')
 *   );
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // 10
 * // 5
 * // 3.3333333333333335
 * // 1
 * // 2
 * // 3
 * // "that's it!"
 *
 * @see {@link concat}
 * @see {@link catch}
 *
 * @param {...ObservableInput} observables Observables passed either directly or as an array.

 * <span class="informal">Timeouts on Observable that doesn't emit values fast enough.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/timeout.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `timeout` operator accepts as an argument either a number or a Date.
 *
 * If number was provided, it returns an Observable that behaves like a source
 * Observable, unless there is a period of time where there is no value emitted.
 * So if you provide `100` as argument and first value comes after 50ms from
 * the moment of subscription, this value will be simply re-emitted by the resulting
 * Observable. If however after that 100ms passes without a second value being emitted,
 * stream will end with an error and source Observable will be unsubscribed.
 * These checks are performed throughout whole lifecycle of Observable - from the moment
 * it was subscribed to, until it completes or errors itself. Thus every value must be
 * emitted within specified period since previous value.
 *
 * If provided argument was Date, returned Observable behaves differently. It throws
 * if Observable did not complete before provided Date. This means that periods between
 * emission of particular values do not matter in this case. If Observable did not complete
 * before provided Date, source Observable will be unsubscribed. Other than that, resulting
 * stream behaves just as source Observable.
 *
 * `timeout` accepts also a Scheduler as a second parameter. It is used to schedule moment (or moments)
 * when returned Observable will check if source stream emitted value or completed.
 *
 * @example <caption>Check if ticks are emitted within certain timespan</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(1100) // Let's use bigger timespan to be safe,
 *                       // since `interval` might fire a bit later then scheduled.
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit numbers just as regular `interval` would.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will never be called.
 * );
 *
 * seconds.timeout(900).subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will never be called.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will emit error before even first value is emitted,
 *                             // since it did not arrive within 900ms period.
 * );
 *
 * @example <caption>Use Date to check if Observable completed</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(new Date("December 17, 2020 03:24:00"))
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit values as regular `interval` would
 *                                  // until December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00.
 *     err => console.log(err) // On December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00 it will emit an error,
 *                             // since Observable did not complete by then.

 * Errors if Observable does not emit a value in given time span, in case of which

 *
 * <span class="informal">It's a version of `timeout` operator that let's you specify fallback Observable.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/timeoutWith.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `timeoutWith` is a variation of `timeout` operator. It behaves exactly the same,
 * still accepting as a first argument either a number or a Date, which control - respectively -
 * when values of source Observable should be emitted or when it should complete.
 *
 * The only difference is that it accepts a second, required parameter. This parameter
 * should be an Observable which will be subscribed when source Observable fails any timeout check.
 * So whenever regular `timeout` would emit an error, `timeoutWith` will instead start re-emitting
 * values from second Observable. Note that this fallback Observable is not checked for timeouts
 * itself, so it can emit values and complete at arbitrary points in time. From the moment of a second
 * subscription, Observable returned from `timeoutWith` simply mirrors fallback stream. When that
 * stream completes, it completes as well.
 *
 * Scheduler, which in case of `timeout` is provided as as second argument, can be still provided
 * here - as a third, optional parameter. It still is used to schedule timeout checks and -
 * as a consequence - when second Observable will be subscribed, since subscription happens
 * immediately after failing check.
 *
 * @example <caption>Add fallback observable</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 * const minutes = Rx.Observable.interval(60 * 1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeoutWith(900, minutes)
 *     .subscribe(
 *         value => console.log(value), // After 900ms, will start emitting `minutes`,
 *                                      // since first value of `seconds` will not arrive fast enough.
 *         err => console.log(err) // Would be called after 900ms in case of `timeout`,
 *                                 // but here will never be called.
 *     );
 *
 * @param {number|Date} due Number specifying period within which Observable must emit values
 *                          or Date specifying before when Observable should complete

 *
 * Returns an Observable that emits windows of items it collects from the source
 * Observable. The output Observable emits windows every `startWindowEvery`
 * items, each containing no more than `windowSize` items. When the source
 * Observable completes or encounters an error, the output Observable emits
 * the current window and propagates the notification from the source
 * Observable. If `startWindowEvery` is not provided, then new windows are
 * started immediately at the start of the source and when each window completes
 * with size `windowSize`.
 *
 * @example <caption>Ignore every 3rd click event, starting from the first one</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var result = clicks.windowCount(3)
 *   .map(win => win.skip(1)) // skip first of every 3 clicks
 *   .mergeAll(); // flatten the Observable-of-Observables
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * @example <caption>Ignore every 3rd click event, starting from the third one</caption>

 * code to end and then it will try to execute given task as fast as possible.
 *
 * `asap` scheduler will do its best to minimize time between end of currently executing code

 * some (although minimal) unwanted delay.
 *
 * Note that using `asap` scheduler does not necessarily mean that your task will be first to process
 * after currently executing code. In particular, if some task was also scheduled with `asap` before,
 * that task will execute first. That being said, if you need to schedule task asynchronously, but
 * as soon as possible, `asap` scheduler is your best bet.
 *
